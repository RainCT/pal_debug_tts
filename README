      *** EXPERIMENTAL ***

This is some quick code for internal use for debugging / testing REEM.

Do NOT depend on it from other places. It WILL change.

If you use this code or are interested in something similar to it, please
come talk to me, as I have some ideas for making a proper tool out of all this.

Utilities:

 * pal_speak:
       command-line tool that speaks out a single sentence.
 * pal_debug_tts:
       "tail -f" like utility that reads messages written to a file and
       speaks them out. Multiple regexes can be provided to choose which
       messages should be spoken.
 * pal_topic_tts:
       speaks out when the value of a topic changes.
